# How to build a search engine from Scratch

Steps:
1. Crawling
2. Parsing
3. Indexing

## Crawling

Seed:

From the first link we pull all the info and links, and from the links we pull further info and links, so on and so forth.

4TB, that's the about storage we are going to have if we do not store media results.
